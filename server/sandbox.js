 'How does he know it’s stolen? Does the card reader say something other than declined?\n\n*EDIT:* I did some research on this because I was really curious and it\'s somewhat related to my work. According to page 38 of the Visa card acceptance guidelines(https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/merchants/card-acceptance-guidelines-for-merchants.pdf) one of the responses can be "Pick Up".\n\n***\n\n|Response|Meaning|\n|:-|:-|\n|Approved|Card issuer approves the transaction. This is the most common response.|\n|Declined or Card Not Accepted|Card issuer does not approve the transaction. The transaction should not be completed. Return the card and instruct the cardholder to call the card issuer for more information on the status of the account.|\n|Call, Call Center, or Referrals|Card issuer needs more information before approving the sale. You should call your authorization center and follow whatever instructions you are given. In most cases, an authorization Agent will ask to speak directly with the cardholder or will instruct you to check the cardholder’s identification.|\n|**Pick Up**|**Card issuer wants to recover the card. Do not complete the transaction. Inform the customer that you have been instructed to keep the card, and ask for an alternative form of payment. If you feel uncomfortable, simply return the card to the cardholder.**|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Recovered Cards\n\nIn general, you should recover a card if you have reasonable grounds for believing the card is being used fraudulently or is altered or counterfeit and it can be done safely. The following situations are considered reasonable grounds for recovery:\n\n* Card security features are missing or irregular, or appear to have been tampered with (See Visa Card Features and Security Elements on page 26 of this document.)\n* The account number on the magnetic-stripe does not match the number embossed on the front of the card (See Doing It Right at the Point of Sale on pages 20 through 25 of this document.)\n* You receive a pick-up response when a card has been swiped for electronic authorization.\n\n## Card Recovery Procedures\n\nThe following card recovery procedures apply to all Visa credit, debit, prepaid and Visa Electron cards:\n\n* Recover the card only if you can do so safely. Never take unnecessary risks.\n* Tell the cardholder you have been instructed to keep the card, and that he or she may call the card issuer for more information.\n* Remain calm and courteous. If the cardholder behaves in a threatening manner, return the card immediately.\n* Make a readable copy of the front and back of the card, if possible.\n* If the recovered card is retained by law enforcement officials, you must give your acquirer a readable copy to be eligible for a reward.\n* Cut the card according to acquirer procedures.\n* Tell your acquirer that you have recovered a card and ask for further instructions.\n\nFor cards that are inadvertently left at a merchant location and remain unclaimed, follow the procedures for contacting your acquirer and sending in the card.\n\n***\n\nAlso, fuck that. I\'m not holding that card in any situation, 100% not my job. Say it\'s declined and let the system figure it out. Obviously the card can\'t be used anymore and they have a record of where it\'s been.',
